* TODO Baseline Captures
** TODO SISO SIM
  1) [X] Tar and copy repo with artifacts
  2) [ ] create random walk model from Farhang's book, chapter 14, state space model
  3) [ ] Create output measure for PAPR
     - [ ] Apply retroactive increased sampling rate to show improvement on channel equalization       
  4) [ ] Simulate higher sampling rate
     - [ ] Attempt to model RMS delay spread or capture from actual experiments

  5) [X] Phase correct using LTS rather than adjacent carrier pilots, !!! THIS DOES NOT WORK !!!
  6) [ ] Remove Zeros frame IQ scatter plot
  7) [ ] Fix output to show
     - [ ] correct symbols, bytes
     - [ ] correct RX vect plot
     - [ ] 
  8) [ ] Capture noise floor
  9) [ ] Sweep Power for BER			
  10) [ ] Plot PSD				
  11) [ ] Show phase offset			
  12) [ ] Address phase offset			
  13) [ ] Fix print output to refect accurate SNR
** TODO SISO Captures
  1) [ ] Measure noise floor
  2) [ ] Create output measure for PAPR

  4) [X] Sweep SISO Power for BER		   
  5) [X] Sweep SISO frame symbol count to 47	   
  6) [ ] Ask about potential sampling rate changes 
  7) [X] Show phase offset			   
  8) [ ] Address phase offset

* TODO CPSCM Captures
** TODO SISO Captures
** TODO MIMO Captures
* TODO Write Final Paper

** Questions
  1) [ ] How is the lts shaped and how is it used for the channel estimate, and how is it applied as the channel changes over time
     - [ ] Would
